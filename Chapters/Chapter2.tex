\section{Previous Programs}
As Kafai and Burke ~\cite{backtoschool} point out, in the 1980s many schools featured Basic or Logo programming, but by the mid 90s, CS declined due to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item lack of subject-matter integration.
	\item no qualified instructors
	\item rise of CD-ROMS and the internet, schools shifted emphasis from programming to software-specific proficiency and web surfing literacy. 
\end{enumerate}
The difference now:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item plethora of coding sites
	\item shift from code to applications
	\item shift from tools to communities 
\end{enumerate}
