I would like to thank Chris Bigenho, the Director of Educational Technology at Greenhill School, for his incredible support and willingness to share CS curriculum and benchmarks. Brad Philipson, the Assistant Head of School at Fort Worth Country Day (FWCD), and Aaron Cadle, a upper school CS teacher at FWCD, were extremely gracious and generous when we toured their school this year to observe their CS program.\par
Xiao Xiao, a Newman alum from `06 and a current Ph.D. student in MIT's Media Lab, helped me finish thinking through the proposed computer science course ecosystem. I am extremely grateful for her input.\par

I would also like to thank Susie Toso for being such a kind host and brave computer science leader in the Lower School! She has been extremely accommodating of my requests to observe coding lessons. Minnette Patton, the Lower School Assistant Head and former computer teacher, has also been extremely helpful in both providing input about CS as well as providing historical context about coding at Newman. \par

And finally, and most importantly, I have to thank Oskie Creech, without whom this document would not be possible. Oskie has been the most incredible mentor---both as it relates to computer science and to my experiences at Newman in general. He has facilitated faculty meeting brainstorms, offered insight into research, set up meetings with key teachers and administrators, and shared lessons about effective pedagogy. Oskie truly deserves enormous credit for helping to pull this research document together.\par
