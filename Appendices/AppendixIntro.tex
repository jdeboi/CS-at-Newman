\lhead{Appendix: \emph{Introductory CS}}


\textbf{Creative Coding}, \textit{Fall} \\
Creative coding uses computer programming as a medium for creative expression. In this course students will use languages like Processing, a visual programming language designed for artists, to code animations or build interactive visualizations on the web. This project-based class also explores the use of programmable tools like Arduinos and 3D printers in the creation of wearable technology and interactive electronic art. \par
Skills\\
D3/Javascript (Web Visualization)\\
Processing/JAVA (Animations)\\
Arduino/C++ (Wearables) \par
\textbf{Physical Computing}, \textit{Spring} \\
Physical computing uses software and hardware to develop interactive physical systems. This course introduces students to coding, robotics, laser cutting, CNC milling, 3D printing, and a variety of programmable tools capable of sensing and responding to real world stimuli. Line-following robots, electronic music instruments, and LED smart bands are just a few examples of potential projects created in this hands-on course. \par
